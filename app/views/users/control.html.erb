Most users have a blank/null global role.<br>

This role is applied only to individual protocol.<br>
A user can have multiple roles for a specific protocol. These roles are applied 
in a cumulative manner. The edit role also allows viewing.<br><br>



<%= link_to('Add roles', '/roles') %> <br><br>


<%= link_to('Add protocol', '/protocols') %>  <br><br>

Enter the new users ldap login, Fisrt Name, Last Name, and Email. <br>
Add protocol roles - default is "edit lower level fields" for all protocols which are needed.<br><br>

<%= link_to('Edit and delete user', '/users/edit_user') %>  <br>
It is better to remove all the protocol roles from a user instead of deleting the user,<br>
so objects created by the user are identifiable. If a user leave UW Health, they will not be able to login<br>
since they will not be in the DOM Ldap server.

 <%= link_to('Edit Radiology Comment links', '/radiology_comments?radiology_comment=""') %>  <br>
The rad_path retrieves the radiology comments linked to a visit. Harvesting of the rad_path
from the Radiology website is dependent on a RMR and scan_number. If the RMR or scan_number
were wrong when the scans were reviewed, the rad_rmr, rad_scan_number and the correct rad_path
can be entered. If the comment_html_* and comment_text_* fields are emptied, the correct 
radiology comment for the visit will be retrieved.
