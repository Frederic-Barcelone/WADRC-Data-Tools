This is the vgroup home!!!


<br>
list last 3 months of vgroups
<br>
dashboard (mri, pet, quality) for each vgroup plus links to appointment_types for each vgroup
<br>
search by <br>
protocol, scan_procedure, enumber, rmr, 

<br> ---- dropdown - scan procedure, expand to list of vgroups

<br><br>
insert mri appointment/scan files<br>
try to find matching vgroup based on RMR and date.
If none- get a enumber - make a vgroup, participant, appointment<br>
generally the vgroup will alway be created automatically, linked to participant when a mri scan is imported --- ?? ask for enumber in import form?<br>
<br><br>
what about merging participants, moving appointment to different vgroup, merging vgroups
<br><br>
also add appointments --- for pet scan, np, lp, lab, demographic, etc. -- link to existing vgroup,<br>
new participants<br>
or make new vgroup<br><br>
search for a vgroup (date range match, enumber, rmr,protocol)
<br>or enter date, enumber, rmr, scan protocol, and dynamic drop down suggests matches.<br><br>


when make a vgroup -- lnk a participant to it.
<br><br>
vgroup - link to enumber(s)
<br><br>

faster search - enumber collection, pagation?
<br><br>
